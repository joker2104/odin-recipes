            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chicken kosha is a delicious and spicy chicken curry that is popular in Bengal and other parts of India. It is made by marinating chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt, ginger, garlic, and spices, and then cooking them in a thick gravy of caramelized onions, tomatoes, and whole spices. The chicken is cooked until it is tender and coated with the rich and flavorful sauce. The dish is usually served with potatoes that are cooked along with the chicken and absorb some of the gravy. Chicken kosha is a perfect dish for special occasions or weekends, and can be enjoyed with steamed rice, roti, or paratha.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1:
                    Begin by creating a smooth paste of ginger by grinding it with 1 tablespoon of water in a grinder jar. Transfer the ginger paste to a bowl. Next, make a fine paste of green chillies using the same method, and transfer it to a separate bowl. Lastly, grind garlic with 1 tablespoon of water to make garlic paste, and keep it in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Step 2:
                    In a pan over medium heat, dry roast green cardamom, cinnamon stick, and cloves until a strong aroma is released. Grind these roasted spices into a coarse powder using a grinder jar. This mixture serves as the freshly made garam masala.</li>
                <li>Step 3:
                    Heat 3 tablespoons of refined oil in a deep-bottomed pan over medium flame. Fry the chopped potatoes until they achieve a golden-brown color. Transfer the fried potatoes to a bowl and return the pan to the medium flame.</li>
                <li>Step 4:
                    Add the remaining oil to the pan. Once hot, caramelize sugar, then add bay leaves and saut√© until aromatic.</li>
                <li>Step 5:
                    Introduce sliced onions to the pan and cook until they turn brown.</li>
                <li>Step 6:
                    Add chicken pieces to the pan with onions and fry. Incorporate green chilli paste, garlic paste, ginger paste, chopped tomatoes, and salt. Mix well and cook until the tomatoes become tender, releasing water from the chicken. Reduce heat to low and add turmeric powder and Kashmiri chilli powder. Ensure the chicken is evenly coated.</li>
                <li>Step 7:
                    Allow it to cook for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is tender. Add the fried potatoes, toss to coat them with the gravy, and sprinkle the freshly made garam masala. Cover and cook for another 20 minutes. Adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
                <li>Step 8:
                    Once the oil separates, remove from heat and transfer the dish to a bowl. Serve it with rice or chapati for a delightful meal!</li>
